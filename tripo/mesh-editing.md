Mesh Editing
Mesh Segmentation
POST https://api.tripo3d.ai/v2/openapi/task
Request
type: Must be set to mesh_segmentation.

model_version (Optional): Model version. Available versions are as below:

v1.0-20250506
original_model_task_id: The task_id of a previous task.

Only the task IDs of the tasks below are supported:

text_to_model

image_to_model

multiview_to_model

texture_model

refine_model

import_model

highpoly_to_lowpoly

Response
task_id: The identifier for the successfully submitted task.
Behaviour
Once the task moves out of the waiting queue, it typically completes within several minutes. After this operation, it will separate the whole model in parts based on the type and shape of it. After segmentation and importing into 3D editing software, like Blender, you will see part names in collection area.
